## Machine Learning: Clustering and Retrieval

### Description
* Built wikipedia article and image retrieval models by using clustering algorithms such as k nearest neighbors, k means, latent dirichlet allocation, and hierarchical clustering.
* Used expectation maximization, locality sensitive hashing, and gibbs sampling to built gaussian mixture and mixed membership models for improved assignment of data-points and clustering.
